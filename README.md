# CROWDPASS

### OVERVIEW
Crowdpass is a decentralized Event management platform, crowdpass aids event organizers to create and manage event ticketing, crowdpass also aids event attendees to purchase, sale and recliam tickets refund in the case of event cancellation.

### PROBLEM
The event industry faces several significant inefficiencies that impact both organizers and attendees.

#### For Organizers:

1. Ticket Management Issues: 
      - ``Duplication of Tickets``: Malicious actors can duplicate tickets, making it difficult to ensure that each ticket is unique and valid.
      - ``Unaccountable Funds``: There is often a lack of transparency and accountability in ticket sales, leading to potential capital and revenue loss. 

#### For Event Attendees:

1. Fake Tickets: Attendees risk purchasing counterfeit tickets, which can prevent them from accessing the event.
2. Refund Insecurities: If an event is canceled, attendees may face difficulties in getting refunds, creating financial insecurity.

   In summary, event organizers struggle with managing ticket sales, preventing fraud, and ensuring proper revenue tracking, while attendees worry about the authenticity of tickets and the security of their funds in case of event cancellations.

### SOLUTION
`Crowdpass` aims to fix all the above inefficiencies through creating tickets in form of nft's and minting these nft's to attendees that purchase the ticket for the said event, also with our recliam functionality event attendees can be able to cliam refunds for tickets on event cancellation.

### TOKENBOUND SOLUTION
with tickets in form of NFT's we can easily make all tickets tokenbound accounts, this will make tickets to be able to hold assets and give all rights / priviledges to the ticket holder. for example: incase where an event attendee decides to sale his tickets, and the event was canceled, the new owner of the nft will get the refund simply beacuse the refunds will be made to the ticket (tba). lastly all digital badges (POAP) for events will be minted to the ticket (tba) which will give the ticket holder the right to all priviledges attached to holding the ticket.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Our smartcontract is an escrow contract, that handles all tickets (nft's) and funds from ticket purchase.
> - Event organizers can monitor but can't claim funds from ticket sales until after event end_date.
> - All tickets are token_bound accounts this is to aid for easy sale from one party to another and maximum security, incase of event cancelation the funds for the ticket is been refunded back to the ticket (tba) and also in events with digital badges (POAP), this badges will be sent to the ticket (tba). This will aid the ticket holder have all priviledges associated with holding the ticket.
